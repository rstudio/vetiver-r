# vetiver: Version, Share, Deploy, and Monitor Models

The goal of 'vetiver' is to provide fluent tooling to version, share,
deploy, and monitor a trained model. Functions handle both recording and
checking the model's input data prototype, and predicting from a remote
API endpoint. The 'vetiver' package is extensible, with generics that
can support many kinds of models.
