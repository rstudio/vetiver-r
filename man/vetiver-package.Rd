\title{vetiver: Version, Share, Deploy, and Monitor Models}
\description{
\if{html}{\figure{logo.png}{options: style='float: right' alt='logo' width='120'}}

The goal of 'vetiver' is to provide fluent tooling to version, share, deploy, and monitor a trained model. Functions handle both recording and checking the model's input data prototype, and predicting from a remote API endpoint. The 'vetiver' package is extensible, with generics that can support many kinds of models.
