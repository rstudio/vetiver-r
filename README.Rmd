> _Vetiver, the oil of tranquility, is used as a stabilizing ingredient in perfumery to preserve more volatile fragrances._

The goal of vetiver is to provide fluent tooling to version, share, deploy, and monitor a trained model. Functions handle both recording and checking the model's input data prototype, and predicting from a remote API endpoint. The vetiver package is extensible, with generics that can support many kinds of models, and available for both R and Python. To learn more about vetiver, see:

- the documentation at <https://vetiver.posit.co/>
- the Python package at <https://rstudio.github.io/vetiver-python/>

You can use vetiver with:

- a [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/) workflow (including [stacks](https://stacks.tidymodels.org/) and [probably](https://probably.tidymodels.org/))
- [caret](https://topepo.github.io/caret/)
- [mlr3](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/)
- [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/R-package/)
- [ranger](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ranger)
- [`lm()`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/stats/html/lm.html) and [`glm()`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/stats/html/glm.html)
- GAMS fit with [mgcv](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mgcv)
- [keras](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/)
- [the luz API for torch](https://torch.mlverse.org/)

## Installation

You can install the released version of vetiver from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("vetiver")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("rstudio/vetiver-r")
```

## Example

A `vetiver_model()` object collects the information needed to store, version, and deploy a trained model. 

```{r}
library(parsnip)
library(workflows)
data(Sacramento, package = "modeldata")

rf_spec <- rand_forest(mode = "regression")
rf_form <- price ~ type + sqft + beds + baths

rf_fit <- 
    workflow(rf_form, rf_spec) %>%
    fit(Sacramento)

library(vetiver)
v <- vetiver_model(rf_fit, "sacramento_rf")
v
```

You can **version** and **share** your `vetiver_model()` by choosing a [pins](https://pins.rstudio.com) "board" for it, including a local folder, Posit Connect, Amazon S3, and more.

```{r message=FALSE}
library(pins)
model_board <- board_temp()
model_board %>% vetiver_pin_write(v)
```

You can **deploy** your pinned `vetiver_model()` via a [Plumber API](https://www.rplumber.io/), which can be [hosted in a variety of ways](https://www.rplumber.io/articles/hosting.html).


```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(plumber)
pr() %>%
  vetiver_api(v) %>%
  pr_run(port = 8088)
```

If the deployed model endpoint is running via one R process (either remotely on a server or locally, perhaps via a [background job in the RStudio IDE](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/tools/jobs.html)), you can make predictions with that deployed model and new data in another, separate R process. First, create a model endpoint:

```{r}
library(vetiver)
endpoint <- vetiver_endpoint("http://127.0.0.1:8088/predict")
endpoint
```

Such a model API endpoint deployed with vetiver will return predictions for appropriate new data.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
new_sac <- Sacramento %>% 
    slice_sample(n = 20) %>% 
    select(type, sqft, beds, baths)

predict(endpoint, new_sac)
#> # A tibble: 20 x 1
#>      .pred
#>      <dbl>
#>  1 165042.
#>  2 212461.
#>  3 119008.
